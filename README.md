# Unmasking Depression via Attention-modulated Text Analysis using Deep Learning

This is an implementation to the paper:- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10421176

In this study, we formulated five deep learning models based on various sequence and CNN layers for better and more accurate detection of depression also the incorporation of attention helped in the designing of five Attention-enabled DL models with increased robustness and accuracy by focusing more on selectively important parts of text input.
